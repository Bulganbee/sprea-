			<h3>For The Rest Of Your Life</h3>
			<p>In the summer of 2007, a well-rested man wearing pajamas and a nightcap shaved off his mustache and reintroduced himself to the world. This image shift was likely the decision of market studies predicting that a younger-looking man would sell more mattresses, or, that in post-9/11 New York, his ambiguous ethnicity was bad for business. This is quintessential branding. When a corporation feels the need to adapt to societal shifts, align with new trends, or recover from a scandal, the easiest thing to do is put on a new face.</p>
			<p>Since the early 2000s there has been a near total embrace of branding by museums, performing arts institutions, and public art organizations. Wally Olins saw this coming, writing in his 2004 book On Brand that after conquering nation-states and cities, branding was moving into the “complex web of organizations principally defined by the fact that they do not exist to make a profit.”<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>The agencies and design consultancies that do this work make no distinction between America Online and the New Museum, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Target and The Met, Citibank and MoMA, or Unilever and the Tate. For them, “Culture” is just another category2 in their portfolios next to Finance, Energy, Hospitality, and Technology.</p>
			<p>Graphic design grew alongside industry, first as a tool for advertising, then as a way for corporations to control visual consistency and appear trustworthy to the public. Throughout all of this, many designers managed to stay connected to the arts which was, after all, the foundation of their profession. The term graphic design may have replaced commercial art but the oxymoron persists in practice, and looking at a sample of work by some of the most celebrated early designers we see equal representation from both sides: Paul Rand worked for Coronet Brandy and designed The Documents of Modern Art publication series; Wim Crouwel designed an identity system for the Dutch financial institution Rabobank while working with the Stedelijk Museum; and Chermayeff and Geismar designed logos for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and The Museum of Modern Art.</p>
			<p>These designers applied the same modernist approach to everything,3 reducing form to make simple logos, and rational systems for organizing information, to give the appearance of efficiency despite the complicated mechanisms working behind the scenes. Branding agencies have taken this reductive approach even further, simplifying entire organizational structures to catchy slogans and “brand essence” statements. In both cases design obscures complexity. This is a welcome sales tool for a corporation selling goods and services, but for institutions it prevents people from entering into a necessary state of confusion that encourages inquiry and dialogue.</p>
